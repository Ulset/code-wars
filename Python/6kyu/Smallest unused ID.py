"""
You've got much data to manage and of course you use zero-based and non-negative ID's to make each data item unique!

Therefore you need a method, which returns the smallest unused ID for your next new data item...

Note: The given array of used IDs may be unsorted. For test reasons there may be duplicate IDs, but you don't have to find or remove them!

Test.assert_equals(next_id([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]), 11)
Test.assert_equals(next_id([5,4,3,2,1]), 0)
Test.assert_equals(next_id([0,1,2,3,5]), 4)
Test.assert_equals(next_id([0,0,0,0,0,0]), 1)
Test.assert_equals(next_id([]), 0)
